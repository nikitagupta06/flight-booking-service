# flight-booking-service

In this project, I have created a flight booking system using Spring Boot and utilized the @Transactional annotation for ensuring transactional consistency. 
The user can enter their personal and travel details like name, email, source, destination, travel date, pickup and arrival time, and fare. After that, the user can make a payment using account number and card type. 
The transactional consistency is maintained using the @Transactional annotation, which ensures that either all of the operations like saving passenger and payment information succeed or fail together. 
Overall, this project provides a seamless and consistent flight booking experience to the end user.
